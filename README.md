*DESCRIPTION*:
        Developed a Python-based program that reads CSV datasets, performs comprehensive data analysis, and generates professional PDF reports. The project demonstrates proficiency in data handling, statistical analysis, and automated documentation, aligning with real-world business intelligence workflows.
I developed a Python program that can read CSV files, analyze the data, and automatically generate a professional PDF report. I used libraries like pandas and NumPy for data handling and analysis, and the fpdf library to design the report with headers, footers, timestamps, and tables. The program calculates key metrics such as total records, revenue statistics, top product, and missing values, and presents them in an executive summary section. I also created a helper function to generate sample datasets for testing. This project helped me strengthen my skills in data analysis, object-oriented programming, and automated reporting, while ensuring the code was clean, modular, and internship-ready.To make the results easy to share, I designed a custom PDFReport class using the fpdf library. The report includes a professional header with a title and timestamp, a footer with page numbers, and well-formatted tables that display sample data. I also added an Executive Summary section that highlights the key findings in a clear, readable format.
One important part of the project was ensuring the code was modular and future-proof. I separated the logic into classes (DataAnalyzer and PDFReport) so that the program can be reused or extended easily. I also fixed deprecation warnings by using updated enums (XPos, YPos) to make the code compatible with the latest library standards.For testing, I wrote a helper function that generates sample datasets with random products, prices, quantities, and revenues. This allowed me to validate the program without needing external files, and it shows how the tool can adapt to different datasets.Also i just hid the depreceation  warning  just for freenesss note that it is not an error.
